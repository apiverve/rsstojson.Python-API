## Installation
	pip install apiverve-rsstojson

---

## Configuration

Before using the rsstojson API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

---

## Usage

The RSS to JSON API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/rsstojson](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/rsstojson).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```
# Import the client module
from apiverve_rsstojson.apiClient import RsstojsonAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = RsstojsonAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")
```

---


### Perform Request
Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```
query = {  "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss" }
```

###### Simple Request

```
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```
